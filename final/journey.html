          <h2>Our Journey</h2>
          <p>
            At Pacific Trails Resort, our story begins with a love for nature
            and the desire to create a peaceful place where guests can reconnect
            with themselves and the world around them. Surrounded by the beauty
            of California’s coastline, our resort combines comfort and adventure
            in perfect harmony. From the gentle sound of the waves to the quiet
            trails that wind through the forest, every detail is designed to
            offer balance and inspiration. Our team believes in sustainable
            hospitality, warm service, and unforgettable experiences. Whether
            you come for hiking, kayaking, or simply to rest under the stars,
            Pacific Trails invites you to slow down, breathe deeply, and
            rediscover the simple joy of being close to nature.
          </p>
          <h2>Our Values</h2>
          <p>
            Our values are simple: stewardship, community, and well-being. We
            protect the coast through low-impact operations, support local
            makers and guides, and create spaces that restore body and mind. We
            lead with warm, thoughtful service, fairness, and safety. Every
            choice—from ingredients to materials—reflects respect for nature,
            people, and the memories guests take home for years to come.
